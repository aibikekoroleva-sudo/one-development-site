Overview
One Development Company is a leading construction developer based in Dubai with a reputation of growth and residential developments. This company was chosen for its ambitious projects, focus on the quality of construction, and its expansion into new markets. Recent projects include Laguna Residence, featuring the first AI-based Smart Ecosystem in the Middle East, and Do Residence, developed in collaboration with singer Amr Diab. It also extends projects to foreign countries like Europe and North Africa.

The site will present One Development as a professional developer of the highest standards. It will have a clear homepage with an overview of the corporation and highlighted projects. The Projects section will contain properties displayed as project cards. There will be an image gallery and floor plans with detailed explanations. The Contact page will have an enquiry form and a location map. A separate page will show licenses and copyrights.

The site will be hosted on an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) model based on Microsoft Azure. A virtual machine will be configured with a static public IP address: 20.174.162.206. Security measures include regular package updates and automatic restarts on critical system processes. All configuration files, scripts, and deployment commands will be documented for reproducibility.

The final deliverable will be a concise marketing website providing a visual presentation of the projects and corporate image of One Development. It will give potential clients and investors easy access to project information, graphics, and contact details. It also demonstrates mastery of cloud server deployment, static web hosting, and basic security administration, making it both a valuable learning project and a useful digital resource.
